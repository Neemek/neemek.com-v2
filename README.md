# Neemek.com v2
This is the second iteration of my (neemek) personal website.

## Technologies
The website was developed using [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/)
with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which allowed
for both API-routes and webpages. Styling was done using bare CSS.

## Development
I used [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management, and therefore the command 
`pnpm run dev` for starting a development server.

## Deployment
I used vercel for deploying the website, and connected it directly
to my domain, [`neemek.com`](https://neemek.com/). I connected it through github actions
for continous deployment. The website is currently hosted there,
and is accessible through this url: https://neemek-com-v2.vercel.app/
